        <p>I'm Tumisang Msiza from South Africa, and I'm thrilled to join this class. With an associate degree in
            multimedia
            graphic design, I've created designs for companies like Raising Stars Academy and Tulesi Consulting
            Engineers. Beyond my
            graphic design passion, I'm captivated by animation, enjoying the process of bringing characters to life
            through motion.
            My interest in animation sparked my curiosity about its technical aspects, leading me to explore software
            development.
            The idea of not only crafting visually appealing animations but also understanding the underlying code
            fascinated me.
            This intersection of artistic creativity and logical problem-solving aligns perfectly with my diverse
            interests. I've
            always loved creating and making things, whether through visually stunning animations or elegantly coded
            software
            solutions. This class, I believe, will further expand my skills, allowing me to contribute to innovative
            projects at the
            crossroads of technology and design. Excited about the possibilities ahead, I look forward to learning and
            collaborating
            with fellow enthusiasts in this dynamic field.</p>
